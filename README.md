# React state challenge

Practice using React state to share dynamic values across different parts of an app.

## Setup

Make sure you have Git and Node (v18) installed.

1. Clone this repo and `cd` into the directory
1. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
1. Run `npm run dev` to start the local dev server

## Checking your work

Each challenge has associated unit tests. You can run each challenge's tests with `./tests 1`, `./tests 2` etc.

Make sure you read test failures carefullyâ€”the output can be noisy but the error message should provide useful information to help you.
